## Motivation

After I left VCNC last year, I had three free months before I go back to my school.
I wanted these three months to be valuable as possible and I planned for doing research, reading books, and doing what I could have not done so far.
At the same time, I was wary of wasting the precious time and being unproductive.
In that sense, I decided to do some work which progress is quantifiable so that I can track my productivity.
Although there were many tasks I could do, such as doing daily exercises or reading a research paper, I decided to do a [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) challenge.
I chose to solve algorithmic problems because I had been thinking that one of my weaknesses is algorithmic thinking (both devising and proving algorithms) and no matter which career path I choose in computer-based domain (either a CS doctorate or a software engineer), algorithmic skills are needed.
Solving problems is also easily quantifiable by the number of problems I solve.
Last but not least, I liked the ranking system of LeetCode that motivated me throughout the challenge.

## How I did it

At first, I was confused how I should do my challenge (e.g. How many problems do I solve in a day? How do I choose problems to solve? How hard should I try myself before looking at answers?, etc.).
It was also frustrating that I could not find any useful article that answers these at the time (Later, I found [this article](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1590467/my-2021-journey-to-solving-1000-leetcode-problems) useful).
So I simply started solving three problems (two easy and one medium difficulty) a day.
After a few days of trial, I find it easy and I increased the number of problems to five, two easy and three medium.
Until then, I did not think of solving difficulty-hard problems because medium problems were not easy either.
It took me about a month to get used to solving a medium problem within an hour.
After reaching that point, I increased the number of daily problems to ten, two hard and eight medium; however, this was too tough and I reduced the number back to five after a week.
Throughout the challenge, I tried really hard not to look answers, related topics, and hints.
I looked answers only when I spent more than 5 hours on a problem or when I made more than four wrong submissions.
I strictly practiced this because I found myself remembering problems and solutions better when I solved the problems entirely by myself.
This practice helped me a lot to improve my algorithmic skills; when I solve a new problem I could remember related problems that I solved before and I could apply the problem solving strategies I learned from them.

## What I learned

Apart from algorithmic skills, I learned how I could make a persistent habit by myself.
There were many daily plans that I attempted previously, such as reading a research paper, writing a Today I Learned article, etc., but I failed to do them persistently.
Persistently doing the LeetCode challenge was not easy either, but it went much better than the previous attempts because it was **_quantifiable_** and **_open to public_**.
Quantifiability is really important because it helps to set a clear goal.
For example, number of problems to solve was a good metric because it was adjustable depending on my daily condition and it also gave the feeling of accomplishment when I finished.
One important thing about doing a daily challenge is you might be obssessed with it too much and might start to spend less time on other important works in your life.
After two months since I started the challenge, I found myself kind of obssessed with solving the problems; it was positive to a certain extent, but I had to limit myself so that I could spend my precious time doing other tasks I originally planned.
Quantifiable goals let you manage this.
Public access to my progress was another important factor.
The fact that how many submissions I make every day is visible to everyone acted as a positive pressure and encouraged me to be persistent.

Now I know how to make successful habits.
My daily challenge is still going on. You can check my progress [here](https://leetcode.com/jhw123/).
