      <H3>‚õ≥ GOAL</H3>
      <p>
        Casting is an e-commerce service for buying used cars. Our goal was 1) to break down the incredulity of buying
        used cars, often originated from obscure information of used cars, and 2) to provide fully contactless process
        to test-drive and purchase used cars without having to meet dealers.
      </p>
      <H3>‚ú® SOLUTION</H3>
      <p>
        In order to convince buyers, we offered them a chance to test-ride cars for 2 days. Buyers could designate a day
        and a place, and we transport cars to the place so that they can test the cars anyway they want. Purchasing the
        cars is also convenient and contactless as document works go through online.

      <p>
        Tada is a ride-hailing service in Korea, used by over 1.5 million people. Tada aims 1) to provide quality ride
        experiences for all, including those with impaired mobility and low accessibility, and 2) to support and protect
        gig economy workers.
      </p>
      <H3>‚ú® SOLUTION</H3>
      <p>
        To improve ride experience, we constantly trained our drivers and offered an assist service for impaired riders.
        9 passenger vans were provided to riders so that they can relax during their ride and can take heavy cargo. Tada
        also offered insurances and incentives for drivers.

      <p>
        Although learning subgoals in worked examples are known to be helpful for transfer in learning, there are few
        system in reality that supports subgoal learning. It is because generating high quality subgoal labels at scale
        and building an interactive system requires significant expert efforts and time.
      </p>
      <H3>‚ú® SOLUTION</H3>
      <p>
        This research project aims to find a zero cost method to build an interactive system that provides personalized
        feedback and supports subgoal learning of math learners, with the help of learner-driven subgoal labeling and
        learnersourcing.
