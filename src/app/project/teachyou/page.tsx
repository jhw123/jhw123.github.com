              We propose TeachYou, an online platform for undergraduate students to learn programming by teaching a
              virtual AI tutee, AlgoBo. Students first write code to solve programming problems and then teach AlgoBo
              the problems as a reflection activity through a chat interface. AlgoBo writes incorrect or incomplete code
              initially and actively asks questions to students. Students can solidify and expand their knowledge by
              answering the questions and correcting AlgoBo&apos;s code.
            </p>
          </BodyText>
          <BodyText>
            <p>
              We use GPT-4, a large language model (LLM) to power AlgoBo. LLMs empower us to create sophisticated
              chatbots without writing thousands of lines of subject-specific programs, which has been the main
              bottleneck for building LBT systems across different subjects. However, we found that GPT-4, as is,
              elicits only rudimentary LBT because GPT-4 is so competent that it solves problems with little help,
              removing opportunities for students to explain. Moreover, GPT-4 rarely asks &quot;why&quot; or
              &quot;how&quot; questions that can effectively help students find their knowledge gaps. To facilitate
              effective LBT with AlgoBo, we added the following three technical components to TeachYou.
            </p>
          </BodyText>

          <Divider marginVertical={24} />

          <h2>
            <SubHeaderText color="Focus" marginBottom={16}>
              ðŸ’¡ Reflect-Respond pipeline to instruct AlgoBo to simulate prescribed misconceptions and knowledge levels
            </SubHeaderText>
          </h2>
          <BodyText>
            <p>
              We created an LLM prompting pipeline that makes AlgoBo&apos;s problem-solving performance customizable and
              improves it only when taught correctly and precisely, making AlgoBo feasible for LBT. The LLM pipeline
              stores the information AlgoBo has learned in a knowledge state and updates it as AlgoBo learns from
              students. To achieve different learning objectives, instructors can empty the knowledge state or populate
              incorrect information to simulate a learner who learns for the first time.
            </p>
          </BodyText>

          <Divider marginVertical={24} />

          <h2>
            <SubHeaderText color="Focus" marginBottom={16}>
              ðŸ’¡ Mode Shifting to make AlgoBo ask context-relevant questions to students
            </SubHeaderText>
          </h2>
          <BodyText>
            <p>
              We also introduce Mode-shifting, in which AlgoBo shifts into questioner mode periodically (e.g., every
              three messages) to enrich tutoring conversations with &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how &quot; questions.
              These thought-provoking questions encourage students to analyze the flow of programs, compare alternative
              implementations, and clarify their explanations. When students&apos; answers are vague or inconsistent,
              AlgoBo asks follow-ups for elaboration and examples until the student gives quality answers that resolve
              AlgoBo&apos;s misconceptions and curiosity. The frequency of questions is configurable, allowing students
              to adjust their cognitive load.
            </p>
          </BodyText>

          <Divider marginVertical={24} />

          <h2>
            <SubHeaderText color="Focus" marginBottom={16}>
              ðŸ’¡ Teaching Helper to encourage students to follow good teaching practices for effective LBT
            </SubHeaderText>
          </h2>
          <BodyText>
            <p>
              Lastly, TeachYou analyzes the tutoring conversation and gives students feedback on their teaching methods
              (e.g., suggesting students ask guiding questions to AlgoBo rather than spoon-feeding it). We use a
              fine-tuned GPT-3.5 to classify message types and teaching patterns in real-time. The feedback pops up
              inside the chat interface with pattern-specific tips for better teaching. Students can recognize and
              exercise the core strategies for good LBT, which they may adopt in future learning.
